The origin of_         _ More           Living organisms have some common structures, chemical reactions and molecular structures. The organisms consist of cells with cell division, they have homochirality of protein and carbohydrate units, and metabolism, and genetics, and they are mortal. The molecular structures and chemical reactions underlying these features are common from the simplest bacteria to human beings. The origin of life is evolutionary with the emergence of a network of spontaneous biochemical reactions, and the evolution has taken place over a very long time. The evolution contains, however some 'landmarks' and bottlenecks, which in a revolutionary manner directed the evolution, and the article tries to establish the order of these events. The article advocates that a possible order in the emergence of life is that the first milestone in prebiotic evolution is at the emergence of homochirality in proteins. The homochirality of peptides is, however, with instability and racemization which causes aging of the peptides and mortality. The metabolism and genetics are established through homochiral enzymes in the Earth's crust for $\\approx$ 4 Gyr ago. Finally, the cells with cell division are established in the Hot Springs environment at the interface between the crust and the Hadean Ocean.         _ Less","","arXiv","3","3","multiple"
"Fool's gold: ligand-receptor interactions and the origins of life","Abstract:                The origins of_         _ More           The origins of life is a question that continues to intrigue scientists across disciplines. One theory - the iron-sulphur theory - suggests that reactions essential to the synthesis of biological materials got their catalytic 'spark' from mineral surfaces such as iron pyrite, commonly known as fool's gold. Additionally, the binding affinity of the ligands synthesised in this 'surface metabolism' acted as an early version of natural selection: more strongly-binding ligands were accumulated into further autocatalytic reactions and the aggregation of complex biological materials. Ligand-receptor binding is thus fundamental to the origins of life. In this paper, we use the iron-sulphur theory as a lens through which to review ligand-receptor interactions as they are more commonly understood today. In particular we focus on the electron tunnelling theory of receptor activation that has emerged from research into quantum biology. We revisit criticism against this theory, particularly the lack of evidence for electron transfer in receptors, to see what insights might be offered by ligand-receptor interactions mediated by iron pyrite at the origins of life. What emerges from this comparison is the central importance of redox activity in receptors, in particular with respect to the recurring presence of the disulphide bond. While the paper is a speculative exercise, we conclude that conductivity in biomolecules, particularly the selective conductivity conferred by appropriate ligand-receptor binding, is a powerful tool for understanding diverse phenomena such as pharmacological potency and viral infection. As such it deserves further investigation.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

However, its original design now struggles to meet the evolving demands of modern society. Three primary defects have emerged: First, the concentration of power among a few dominant entities has intensified international conflicts and widened the technological divide. Second, the Internet Protocol (IP)-based system lacks inherent security, leading to frequent global cybersecurity incidents. Third, the rigidity of the IP protocol has hindered the sustainable development of cyberspace, as it resists necessary adaptations and innovations. Addressing these issues is crucial for the future resilience and security of the global digital landscape.   To address these challenges, we propose the Co-governed Multi-Identifier Network (CoG-MIN briefly as MIN), a novel network architecture that leverages blockchain technology to ensure equal participation of countries worldwide in cyberspace governance and the rule of law. As a next-generation network system, CoG-MIN integrates mechanisms such as user authentication, data signatures, and encryption to significantly enhance network security. In testing environments, CoG-MIN has consistently withstood extensive attacks during various international cybersecurity competitions. Additionally, CoG-MIN supports the evolution and interoperability of different identifier systems, remains IP-compatible, and facilitates a gradual transition away from IP, providing an adaptable ecosystem for diverse network architectures. This adaptability fosters the development and evolution of diverse network architectures within CoG-MIN, making it a natural progression for the internet's future development.

"An RNA condensate model for the origin of life","Abstract:                _widespread support for the RNA World, self-replicating RNAs have yet to be identified in a natural context, leaving a key 'missing link' for this explanation of the origin of_         _ More           The RNA World hypothesis predicts that self-replicating RNAs evolved before DNA genomes and coded proteins. Despite widespread support for the RNA World, self-replicating RNAs have yet to be identified in a natural context, leaving a key 'missing link' for this explanation of the origin of life. Inspired by recent work showing that condensates of charged polymers can create electrochemical gradients capable of catalyzing hydrolysis, we consider a catalytic RNA condensate as a candidate for the self-replicating RNA. We develop a theoretical framework where an RNA condensate formed by the spontaneous demixing of disordered RNA sequences undergoes self-replicative amplification. Our theory addresses two central problems in the origins of life: (i) the origin of compartmentalization and (ii) the error threshold for the accuracy of templated replication. We show that many of the needed properties of this self-replicating RNA condensate have been realized experimentally in recent studies and can be formalized within a standard polymer physics framework. Specifically, we propose that short, low-complexity RNA polymers formed catalytic condensates capable of templated RNA polymerization. Because the condensate properties depend on the RNA sequences, RNAs that formed condensates with improved polymerization and demixing capacity would be amplified, leading to a 'condensate chain reaction' and evolution by natural selection. We believe this prediction could be tested with current experimental and theoretical tools. Furthermore, we note that the extant nucleolus appears to satisfy many of the requirements of an evolutionary relic for the model we propose. More generally, we suggest that future work on the origin of life would benefit from condensate-centric biophysical models of RNA evolution.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","3","synthetic_biology"

Given that LECRs interact with the surrounding medium to produce nuclear de-excitation line emissions, which are gamma-ray emissions with energy mainly within 0.1--10 MeV and are unaffected by stellar wind modulation, these emissions can accurately reflect the properties of LECRs. This study introduces an innovative method for using gamma-ray emissions to infer LECR properties. We employed the Parker transport equation to simulate the propagation and spectral evolution of LECRs in a protoplanetary disk and calculated the characteristic gamma-ray emissions resulting from interactions between LECRs and disk material. These gamma-ray emissions encapsulate the spectral information of LECRs, providing a powerful tool to reconstruct the cosmic ray environment at that time. This method, supported by further theoretical developments and observations, will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the impact of CRs on the origin and evolution of planetary systems and address significant scientific questions regarding the cosmic ray environment at the origin of life.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

This goal will entail technical innovation in a number of contexts, including that of healthcare. All life on Earth shares an evolution that is coupled to specific environmental conditions, including gravitational and magnetic fields. While the human body may be able to adjust to short term disruption of these fields during space flights, any long term settlement would have to take into consideration the effects that different fields will have on biological systems, within the space of one lifetime, but also across generations. Magnetic fields, for example, influence the growth of stem cells in regenerative processes. Circadian rhythms are profoundly influenced by magnetic fields, a fact that will likely have an effect on mental as well as physical health. Even the brain responds to small perturbations of this field. One possible mechanism for the effects of weak magnetic fields on biological systems has been suggested to be the radical pair mechanism. The radical pair mechanism originated in the context of spin chemistry to describe how magnetic fields influence the yields of chemical reactions. This mechanism was subsequently incorporated into the field of quantum biology. Quantum biology, most generally, is the study of whether non-trivial quantum effects play any meaningful role in biological systems. The radical pair mechanism has been used most consistently in this context to describe the avian compass. Recently, however, a number of studies have investigated other biological contexts in which the radical pair might play a role, from the action of anaesthetics and antidepressants, to microtubule development and the proper function of the circadian clock...

This non-exhaustive chapter follows multiple threads from planet formation to the origin of life. We place significant emphasis on the solar system context for the Earth, the timing and nature of crustal formation and the evolution of the surface and atmosphere. Several scenarios for prebiotic chemistry are also discussed including atmospheric photochemistry, wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles, and hydrothermal vent systems. We attempt to draw connections between the large-scale, planetary processes and various origin of life pathways to illustrate possible overlaps and correlations. In detail, we conclude with and discuss the 'impact of impacts' to show how asteroid and comet impacts during the Hadean may have affected many of these processes and scenarios, from generating land to altering the chemical composition and oxidation state of the early Earth's atmosphere and surface.         _ Less","","arXiv","3","1","origin_of_life"

This implies a region of liquid water beneath the surface ice shell. Since liquid water would be essential for the origin of life, it is important to understand the development of these internal oceans, particularly their temperature distribution and evolution. The balance between tidal heating and radiative cooling is believed to sustain liquid water beneath an icy moon's surface. We aim to simulate the tidal heating of an internal ocean in an icy moon using 3-dimensional numerical fluid calculations with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We incorporated viscosity and thermal conduction terms into the governing equations of SPH. However, we encountered two issues while calculating rigid body rotation using SPH with a viscous term: (1) conventional viscosity formulations generated unphysical forces that hindered rotation, and (2) there was artificial internal energy partitioning within the layered structure, which was due to the standard SPH formulations. To address the first issue, we modified the viscosity formulation.For the second, we adopted Density Independent SPH (DISPH) developed in previous studies to improve behavior at discontinuous surfaces. Additionally, we implemented radiative cooling using an algorithm to define fluid surfaces via the particle method. We also introduced an equation of state accounting for phase transitions. With these modifications, we have refined the SPH method to encompass all necessary physical processes for simulating the evolution of icy moons with internal oceans.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N $\\geq$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of $\\approx$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to $\\sim$hours).

"Theory for sequence selection via phase separation and oligomerization","Abstract:                _highlight that out-of-equilibrium condensed phases could provide versatile hubs for Darwinian-like evolution toward functional sequences, both relevant for the molecular origin of life and de novo life.         _ More           Non-equilibrium selection pressures were proposed for the formation of oligonucleotides with rich functionalities encoded in their sequences, such as catalysis. Since phase separation was shown to direct various chemical processes, we ask whether condensed phases can provide mechanisms for sequence selection. To answer this question, we use non-equilibrium thermodynamics and describe the reversible oligomerization of different monomers to sequences at non-dilute conditions prone to phase separation. We find that when sequences oligomerize, their interactions give rise to phase separation, boosting specific sequences' enrichment and depletion. Our key result is that phase separation gives rise to a selection pressure for the oligomerization of specific sequence patterns when fragmentation maintains the system away from equilibrium. Specifically, slow fragmentation favors alternating sequences that interact well with their environment (more cooperative), while fast fragmentation selects sequences with extended motifs capable of specific sequence interactions (less cooperative). Our results highlight that out-of-equilibrium condensed phases could provide versatile hubs for Darwinian-like evolution toward functional sequences, both relevant for the molecular origin of life and de novo life.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

The 60Fe peak deposits found in the deep-sea crust have been interpreted by the imprints left by the ejecta of supernova explosions occurring about 2-3 and 5-6 Myr ago. It is likely that the 60Fe peak at about 2-3 Myr originated from a supernova occurring in the Upper Centaurus Lupus association in Scorpius Centaurus (140 pc) or the Tucana Horologium association (70 pc). Whereas, the 5-6 Myr peak is likely attributed to the solar system's entrance into the bubble. In this Letter, we show that the supernova source responsible for synthesizing the 60Fe peak deposits 2-3 Myr ago was also likely a Galactic PeVatron source. We demonstrate that this supernova can consistently explain the 'knee' in the cosmic-ray spectrum and the large-scale anisotropy between 100 TeV and 100 PeV. Matching the intensity and shape of the cosmic-ray spectrum allows us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic-ray energy content from the supernova as well as on the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Making use of such constraints we provide a robust estimate of the temporal variation of terrestrial ionizing cosmic radiation levels and discuss their implications in the development of early life on Earth by plausibly influencing the mutation rate and, as such, conceivably assisting in the evolution of complex organisms.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

The distribution of O between H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$ in chemical equilibrium subsequently changes significantly with decreasing temperature. We explore here two chemical models: one where CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ are assumed to be irrevocably destroyed by photolysis, and one where these molecules persist. In the first case, we show that CO cannot co-exist with H$_2$O, since CO oxidizes at low temperatures to form CO$_2$ and H$_2$. In both cases, H escapes from the thermosphere within a few ten million years by absorption of stellar XUV radiation. This escape drives an atmospheric self-oxidation process whereby rocky planet atmospheres become dominated by CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, regardless of their initial oxidation state at outgassing. HCN is considered a potential precursor of prebiotic compounds and RNA. Our oxidizing atmospheres are inefficient at producing HCN by lightning. Instead, we demonstrate that lightning-produced NO, which dissolves as nitrate in the oceans, and interplanetary dust particles may be the main sources of fixed nitrogen to emerging biospheres.

Our analysis focused on the distribution of $\\rm CH_4$, $\\rm CO_2$, $\\rm H_2O$, $\\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0 micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract the $\\rm CH_4$, $\\rm CO_2$, $\\rm H_2O$, $\\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results reveal that the spatial distribution of $\\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the 'Classical' dark-cloud chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes. These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

Due to the challenge of simultaneously obtaining accurate depth and texture information with a single sensor, multimodal data captured by cameras and LiDAR is commonly used to enhance performance. Additionally, cloud-edge cooperation has emerged as a novel computing approach to improve user experience and ensure data security in machine vision systems. This paper proposes a pioneering solution to address the feature compression problem in multimodal 3D object detection. Given a sparse tensor-based object detection network at the edge device, we introduce two modes to accommodate different application requirements: Transmission-Friendly Feature Compression (T-FFC) and Accuracy-Friendly Feature Compression (A-FFC). In T-FFC mode, only the output of the last layer of the network's backbone is transmitted from the edge device. The received feature is processed at the cloud device through a channel expansion module and two spatial upsampling modules to generate multi-scale features. In A-FFC mode, we expand upon the T-FFC mode by transmitting two additional types of features. These added features enable the cloud device to generate more accurate multi-scale features. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset using the VirConv-L detection network showed that T-FFC was able to compress the features by a factor of 6061 with less than a 3% reduction in detection performance. On the other hand, A-FFC compressed the features by a factor of about 901 with almost no degradation in detection performance. We also designed optional residual extraction and 3D object reconstruction modules to facilitate the reconstruction of detected objects. The reconstructed objects effectively reflected details of the original objects.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

However, a tree fails to capture ancestral reticulate processes, such as the formation of hybrid species or lateral gene transfer events between lineages, and so the history of life is more accurately described by a rooted phylogenetic network. Nevertheless, phylogenetic networks may be complex and difficult to interpret, so biologists sometimes prefer a tree that summarises the central tree-like trend of evolution. In this paper, we formally investigate methods for transforming an arbitrary phylogenetic network into a tree (on the same set of leaves) and ask which ones (if any) satisfy a simple consistency condition. This consistency condition states that if we add additional species into a phylogenetic network (without otherwise changing this original network) then transforming this enlarged network into a rooted phylogenetic tree induces the same tree on the original set of species as transforming the original network. We show that the LSA (lowest stable ancestor) tree method satisfies this consistency property, whereas several other commonly used methods (and a new one we introduce) do not. We also briefly consider transformations that convert arbitrary phylogenetic networks to another simpler class, namely normal networks.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","2","synthetic_biology"

Zachar et al.'s critique of SOR stems from misunderstandings; it does not weaken the arguments in (Gabora & Steel, 2021). The formal framework of Reflexively Autocatalytic and foodset-derived sets (RAFs) enables us to model the process whereby, through their interactions, a set of elements become a 'collective self.' SOR shows how the RAF setting provides a means of encompassing abiogenesis and cultural evolution under the same explanatory framework and provides a plausible explanation for the origins of both evolutionary processes. Although SOR allows for detrimental stimuli (and products), there is (naturally) limited opportunity for elements that do not contribute to or reinforce a RAF to become part of it. Replication and cumulative, adaptive change in RAFs is well-established in the literature. Contrary to Zachar et al., SOR is not a pure percolation model (such as SIR); it encompasses not only learning (modeled as assimilation of foodset elements) but also creative restructuring (modeled as generation of foodset-derived elements), as well as the emergence of new structures made possible by new foodset- and foodset-derived elements. Cultural SOR is robust to degradation, and imperfect replication. Zachar et al.'s simulation contains no RAFs, and does not model SOR.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

We argue that this may be an important omission, because the signature replication behaviour of life represents temporal memory in the dynamics of ecosystems, that signifies the absence of mixing properties (i.e., the dynamics are not fully chaotic), and entrainment onto regular, periodic external perturbative influences has been proven capable of suppressing chaos, and thus may bring otherwise unstable chemical reaction sets into viability, as precursors to abiogenesis. As well, external perturbations may be necessary to prevent an open dissipative (bio)chemical system from collapsing into the opposite extreme -- the point attractor of thermal equilibrium. In short, life may precariously rest on the edge of chaos, and open-loop periodic perturbation rooted in celestial mechanics (and should be simulated in laboratory experiments in origin-of-life studies) may help with the balancing. Such considerations, if pertinent, would also be consequential to exobiology, e.g., in regard to tidal-locking properties of potential host worlds.         _ Less","","arXiv","3","0","origin_of_life"

It is then shown that the application of these principles to the results obtained with the IdLE-IdLA mathematical model for the simulation of aggregative processes, leads to the conclusion that the primordial formation of self-replicating structures is difficult to reconcile with deterministic aggregative dynamics in the classical sense. Regardless of the extent to which the process itself is governed by chance or by aggregative codes written in the laws of chemistry, no conventional causality is likely. The model itself suggests only one possible way out, consistent with thermodynamics: the existence of information sets rushing into the system in a different way from the perceived time stream. The possibilities offered by quantum mechanics and its most recent interpretations are consequently investigated to try to interpret, at the level of particle physics, the suggestion of IdLE-IdLA model. The attempt leads to a mutual accreditation of macroscopic telepoiesis and a kind of quantum retrocausality. The result is a vision of the natural world in which the coexistence of causal and retrocausal dynamics is presented as a possible interpretative key of the whole complex of vital manifestations.         _ Less","","arXiv","3","1","origin_of_life"

In the absence of driving, we characterize the uniqueness of the steady state and identify the percolation of a giant connected component in these networks as the number of reactions increases. When subject to chemical driving (influx and outflux of chemical species), the steady state can undergo bifurcations, leading to multistability or oscillatory dynamics. By quantifying the prevalence of these bifurcations, we show how chemical driving and network sparsity tend to promote the emergence of these complex dynamics and increased rates of entropy production. We show that catalysis also plays an important role in the emergence of complexity, strongly correlating with the prevalence of bifurcations.

Assessing its value is impeded by the lack of an accepted theory for the origin of life, and is further complicated by the existence of selection biases. Appealing uncritically to some version of the ``Principle of Mediocrity'' -- namely, the supposed typicality of what transpired on Earth -- is problematic on empirical or logical grounds. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian statistical approach to put on rigorous footing the inference of lower bounds for the probability of abiogenesis, based on current and future evidence. We demonstrate that the single datum that life has appeared at least once on Earth merely sets weak constraints on the minimal probability of abiogenesis. In fact, the {\\it a priori} probability assigned to this event (viz., optimistic, pessimistic or agnostic prior) exerts the strongest influence on the final result. We also show that the existence of a large number of habitable worlds does not necessarily imply, by itself, a high probability that life should be common in the universe. Instead, as delineated before, the choice of prior, which is subject to uncertainty (i.e., admits multiple scenarios), strongly influences the likelihood of life being common. If habitable worlds are uncommon, for an agnostic prior, a deterministic scenario for the origin of life might be favoured over one where abiogenesis is a fluke event.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","0","origin_of_life"

However, the presumed presence of liquid water on the CHZ planets does not guarantee suitable environments for the emergence of life. According to experimental studies, the building blocks of life are most likely produced photochemically in presence of a minimum ultraviolet (UV) flux. On the other hand, high UV flux can be life-threatening, leading to atmospheric erosion and damaging biomolecules essential to life. These arguments raise questions about the actual habitability of CHZ planets around stars other than Solar-type ones, with different UV to bolometric luminosity ratios. By combining the 'principle of mediocricy' and recent experimental studies, we define UV boundary conditions (UV-habitable Zone, UHZ) within which life can possibly emerge and evolve. We investigate whether exoplanets discovered in CHZs do indeed experience such conditions. By analysing Swift-UV/Optical Telescope data, we measure the near ultraviolet (NUV) luminosities of 17 stars harbouring 23 planets in their CHZ.

These inhomogeneities can be caused by star spots, clouds, and vortices. Star spots and associated stellar flares play a significant role in habitability, either stifling life or catalyzing abiogenesis depending on the emission frequency, magnitude, and orientation. Clouds and vortices may be the source of spectral and photometric variability observed at the L/T transition of BDs and are expected in gas giant exoplanets. We develop a versatile analytical framework to model and infer surface inhomogeneities which can be applied to both spectroscopic and photometric data. This model is validated against a slew of numerical simulations. Using archival spectroscopic and photometric data, we infer star spot parameters (location, size, and contrast) and generate global surface maps for Luhman 16B (an early T dwarf and one of our solar system's nearest neighbors at a distance of approximately 2 pc). We confirm previous findings that Luhman 16B's atmosphere is inhomogeneous with time-varying features. In addition, we provide tentative evidence of longer timescale atmospheric structures such as dark equatorial and bright mid-latitude to polar spots. These findings are discussed in the context of atmospheric circulation and dynamics for ultracool dwarfs. Our analytical model will be valuable in assessing the feasibility of using ELTs to study surface inhomogeneities of gas giant exoplanets and other ultracool objects.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

As stars become cooler, they flare less frequently; therefore, it is unlikely that planets around the very reddest dwarfs would enter the `abiogenesis' zone or drive visible-light photosynthesis through flares alone.         _ More           We present a study of photometric flares on 154 low-mass ($\\leq 0.2 \\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$) objects observed by the SPECULOOS-South Observatory from 1st June 2018 to 23rd March 2020. In this sample we identify 85 flaring objects, ranging in spectral type from M4 to L0. We detect 234 flares in this sample, with energies between $10^{29.2}$ and $10^{32.7}$ erg, using both automated and manual methods. With this work, we present the largest photometric sample of flares on late-M and ultra-cool dwarfs to date. By extending previous M dwarf flare studies into the ultra-cool regime, we find M5-M7 stars are more likely to flare than both earlier, and later, M dwarfs. By performing artificial flare injection-recovery tests we demonstrate that we can detect a significant proportion of flares down to an amplitude of 1 per cent, and we are most sensitive to flares on the coolest stars. Our results reveal an absence of high-energy flares on the reddest dwarfs. To probe the relations between rotation and activity for fully convective stars, we extract rotation periods for fast rotators and lower-bound period estimates of slow rotators. These rotation periods span from 2.2 hours to 65 days, and we find that the proportion of flaring stars increases for the very fastest rotators. Finally, we discuss the impact of our flare sample on planets orbiting ultra-cool stars. As stars become cooler, they flare less frequently; therefore, it is unlikely that planets around the very reddest dwarfs would enter the `abiogenesis' zone or drive visible-light photosynthesis through flares alone.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Recent work in continuous CA has generated a wide variety of compelling bioreminiscent patterns, and the expansion of CA research into continuously-valued domains, multiple channels, and higher dimensions complicates their study. In this work we devise a strategy for evolving CA and CA patterns in two steps, based on the simple idea that CA are likely to be complex and computationally capable if they support patterns that grow indefinitely as well as patterns that vanish completely, and are difficult to predict the difference in advance. The second part of our strategy evolves patterns by selecting for mobility and conservation of mean cell value. We validate our pattern evolution method by re-discovering gliders in 17 of 17 Lenia CA, and also report 4 new evolved CA and 1 randomly evolved CA that support novel evolved glider patterns.

Although many spaceflight experiments were performed in the past to test for potential terrestrial organisms as Panspermia seeds, it is uncertain whether such organisms will likely 'seed' a new planet even if they are able to survive spaceflight. Therefore, rather than using organisms, using abiotic chemicals as seeds has been proposed as part of the molecular Panspermia hypothesis. Here, as an extension of this hypothesis, we introduce and review the plausibility of a polymeric material-based Panspermia seed (M-BPS) theoretical concept, where the type of polymeric material that can function as a M-BPS must be able to: 1) survive spaceflight, and 2) 'function', i.e., contingently drive chemical evolution towards some form of abiogenesis once arriving on a foreign planet.   We use polymeric gels as a model example of a potential M-BPS. Polymeric gels that can be prebiotically synthesized on one planet (such as polyester gels) could be transferred to another planet via meteoritic transfer, where upon landing on a liquid bearing planet, can assemble into structures containing cellular-like characteristics and functionalities. Such features presupposed that these gels can assemble into compartments through phase separation to accomplish relevant functions such as encapsulation of primitive metabolic, genetic and catalytic materials, exchange of these materials, motion, coalescence, and evolution. All of these functions can result in the gels' capability to alter local geochemical niches on other planets, thereby allowing chemical evolution to lead to OoL events.         _ Less","","arXiv","3","1","origin_of_life"

We find seven stars which show evidence of QPPs. Using Fourier and Empirical Mode Decomposition techniques, we confirm the presence of 11 QPPs in these seven stars with a period between 10.2 and 71.9 min, including an oscillation with strong drift in the period and a double-mode oscillation. The fraction of flares we examined which showed QPPs (7 percent) is higher than other studies of stellar flares, but is very similar to the fraction of Solar C-class flares. Based on the stellar parameters taken from the TESS Input Catalog, we determine the lengths and magnetic field strengths of the flare coronal loops using the period of the QPPs and various assumptions about the origin of the QPPs. We also use a scaling relationship based on flares from Solar and Solar-type stars and the observed energy, plus the duration of the flares, finding that the different approaches predict loop lengths which are consistent to a factor of $\\sim$2.

Efforts to infer the rate of abiogenesis, based on its early emergence, are frustrated by the selection effect that if the evolution of intelligence is a slow process, then life's early start may simply be a prerequisite to our existence, rather than useful evidence for optimism. In this work, we interpret the chronology of these two events in a Bayesian framework, extending upon previous work by considering that the evolutionary timescale is itself an unknown that needs to be jointly inferred, rather than fiducially set. We further adopt an objective Bayesian approach, such that our results would be agreed upon even by those using wildly different priors for the rates of abiogenesis and evolution - common points of contention for this problem. It is then shown that the earliest microfossil evidence for life indicates that the rate of abiogenesis is at least 2.8 times more likely to be a typically rapid process, rather than a slow one. This modest limiting Bayes factor rises to 8.7 if we accept the more disputed evidence of C13 depleted zircon deposits (Bell et al. 2015). For intelligence evolution, it is found that a rare-intelligence scenario is slightly favored at 3:2 betting odds. Thus, if we re-ran Earth's clock, one should statistically favor life to frequently re-emerge, but intelligence may not be as inevitable.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

A polymer longer than 40--100 nucleotides is necessary to expect a self-replicating activity, but the formation of such a long polymer having a correct nucleotide sequence by random reactions seems statistically unlikely. However, our universe, created by a single inflation event, likely includes more than $10^{100}$ Sun-like stars. If life can emerge at least once in such a large volume, it is not in contradiction with our observations of life on Earth, even if the expected number of abiogenesis events is negligibly small within the observable universe that contains only $10^{22}$ stars.

We measure the variability of the near ultraviolet (NUV) flux and estimate the far ultraviolet (FUV) flux with a correlation between FUV and NUV flux of a sample of low-mass stars in the GALEX archive. We highlight the presence of a dominating X-ray source close to the J2000 coordinates of LHS 1140, characterize its spectrum, and derive an X-ray flux upper limit for LHS 1140. We find that this contaminant source could have influenced the previously estimated spectral energy distribution. No significant variation of the NUV flux of LHS 1140 is found over 3 months, and we do not observe any flare during the 38 ks on the target. LHS 1140 is in the 25th percentile of least variable M4-M5 dwarfs of the GALEX sample. Analyzing the UV flux experienced by the HZ planet LHS 1140b, we find that outside the atmosphere it receives a NUV flux <2% with respect to that of the present-day Earth, while the FUV/NUV ratio is ~100-200 times higher. This represents a lower limit to the true FUV/NUV ratio since the GALEX FUV band does not include Lyman-alpha, which dominates the FUV output of low-mass stars. This is a warning for future searches for biomarkers, which must take into account this high ratio. The relatively low level and stability of UV flux experienced by LHS 1140b should be favorable for its present-day habitability.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Starting from a peptide/IMT-based genetics, plausible processes could support the elaboration of genetic and metabolic complexity in an early-Earth environment, both explaining the emergence of homochirality and providing a potential bridge to nucleic acid metabolism.

While some constraints do exist (e.g., zircon evidence for surface liquid water), relatively few constraints exist on the abundances of trace chemical species, which are relevant to assessing the plausibility and guiding the development of postulated prebiotic chemical pathways which depend on these species. In this work, we combine literature photochemistry models with simple equilibrium chemistry calculations to place constraints on the plausible range of concentrations of sulfidic anions (HS$^-$, HSO$_3^{-}$, SO$_3^{2-}$) available in surficial aquatic reservoirs on early Earth due to outgassing of SO$_2$ and H$_2$S and their dissolution into small shallow surface water reservoirs like lakes. We find that this mechanism could have supplied prebiotically relevant levels of SO$_2$-derived anions, but not H$_2$S-derived anions.

We apply our results to the case study of the proposed prebiotic reaction network of Patel et al. (2015), and discuss the implications for improving its prebiotic plausibility. In general, epochs of moderately high volcanism could have been especially conducive to cyanosulfidic prebiotic chemistry.

I argue that models for abiogenesis are more likely to work when considered inside such micro-environments. As the supercluster breaks up, biochemical systems in such micro-environments gradually become subject to a less filtered environment, allowing them to get adapted to the more complex outside environment. A particular system originating from a particular location on some supercluster would have been the first to get adapted to the raw outside environment and survive there, thereby becoming the first microbe. A collision of a microbe-containing proto-planet with the Moon could have led to fragments veering off back into space, microbes in small fragments would have been able to survive a subsequent impact with the Earth.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","0","origin_of_life"

Simultaneously, recent experimental and theoretical work suggests that UV light may have played a key role in the origin of life on Earth, and especially the origin of RNA. Characterizing the UV environment on M-dwarfs planets is important to understanding whether life as we know it could emerge on such worlds. In this work, we couple radiative transfer models to observed M-dwarf spectra to determine the UV environment on prebiotic Earth-analog planets orbiting M-dwarfs. We calculate dose rates to quantify the impact of different host stars on prebiotically-important photoprocesses. We find that M-dwarf planets have access to 100-1000 times less bioactive UV fluence than the young Earth.

Laboratory studies of the sensitivity of putative prebiotic pathways to irradiation level are required to resolve this uncertainty.

These findings have revived interest in the hypothesis that prebiotically important molecules or even nascent life may have formed on Mars and been transferred to Earth. UV light plays a key role in prebiotic chemistry. Characterizing the early Martian surface UV environment is key to understanding how Mars compares to Earth as a venue for prebiotic chemistry.   Here, we present two-stream multi-layer calculations of the UV surface radiance on Mars at 3.9 Ga, to constrain the surface UV environment as a function of atmospheric state. We explore a wide range of atmospheric pressures, temperatures and compositions, corresponding to the diversity of Martian atmospheric states consistent with available constraints. We include the effects of clouds and dust. We calculate dose rates to quantify the effect of different atmospheric states on UV-sensitive prebiotic chemistry.   We find that for normative clear-sky CO2-H2O atmospheres, the UV environment on young Mars is comparable to young Earth. This similarity is robust to moderate cloud cover: thick clouds ($_$>100) are required to significantly affect the Martian UV environment, because cloud absorption is degenerate with atmospheric CO2. On the other hand, absorption from SO2, H2S, and dust is nondegenerate with CO2, meaning if they can build up to high levels, surface UV fluence will be suppressed. These absorbers have spectrally variable absorption, meaning that their presence affects prebiotic pathways in different ways. In particular, high SO2 environments may admit UV fluence that favors pathways conducive to abiogenesis over pathways unfavorable to it.

Estimates of the abundance of life's building blocks are confounded by incomplete knowledge of the role of chirality and racemization in organic compounds in the origination of living organisms. Chirality is an essential feature of enzymes as well as many lock-and-key type structures. There are four known processes that can act on complex organic molecules to promote racemization for abiogenesis: quantum-tunneling effects; selection via interaction with circularly polarized light (CPL); templating processes; and interactions with electrical and magnetic (EM) fields. These occur in different places, respectively: cold interstellar space; regions of space with energetic photons, dust and/or magnetic fields; and mineral surfaces (for both templating and EM fields). Chirality as a feature of terrestrial life suggests neither a special place for local development of homochirality nor for extra-terrestrial enrichment and delivery. The presence of these molecules in three competing scenarios for life's origin - chemical gardens, geothermal fields, and ice substrates - relies on a framework of hypothesis and estimation. An easily-modified worksheet is included in the supplemental material that allows a user to generate different scenarios and data related to the distribution of chiral organic molecules as building blocks for living organisms within the galaxy. A simple hypothetical mechanism for planetary magnetic field reversals, based on a high-density plasma inner core, is also presented as a means to aid in estimating field polarity and hence the orientation of racemization processes based on planetary magnetic fields.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

However, considerable uncertainty exists as to planetary conditions and hence surface UV at abiogenesis. Here, we present two-stream multi-layer clear-sky calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of >10.4; for the same atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Surface conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences. For climatically reasonable levels of CO2, fluence shortward of 189 nm is screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding from CO2 also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible levels of CH4, O2, and O3. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off comparatively slowly with increasing CO2 levels. However, if SO2 and/or H2S can build up to the 1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H2O is a robust UV shield for <198 nm. This means that regardless of the levels of other atmospheric gases, fluence <198 nm is only available for cold, dry atmospheres, meaning sources with emission <198 nm (e.g. ArF eximer lasers) can only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254 nm is unshielded by H2O and is available across a broad range of CO2 columns, meaning that mercury lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in primordial H2O and CO2 levels.         _ Less","","arXiv","3","0","origin_of_life"

In this work, we explore the impact of UV light on prebiotic chemistry that might occur in liquid water on the surface of a planet with an atmosphere. We consider effects including atmospheric absorption, attenuation by water, and stellar variability to constrain the UV input as a function of wavelength. We conclude that the UV environment would be characterized by broadband input, and wavelengths below 204 nm and 168 nm would be shielded out by atmospheric CO2 and water, respectively. We compare this broadband prebiotic UV input to the narrowband UV sources (e.g. mercury lamps) often used in laboratory studies of prebiotic chemistry, and explore the implications for the conclusions drawn from these experiments. We consider as case studies the ribonucleotide synthesis pathway of Powner et al (2009) and the sugar synthesis pathway of Ritson et al (2012). Irradiation by narrowband UV light from a mercury lamp formed an integral component of these studies: we quantitatively explore the impact of more realistic UV input on the conclusions that can be drawn from these experiments. Finally, we explore the constraints solar UV input places on the buildup of prebiotically important feedstock gasses like CH4 and HCN. Our results demonstrate the importance of characterizing the wavelength dependence (action spectra) of prebiotic synthesis pathways to determine how pathways derived under laboratory irradiation conditions will function under planetary prebiotic conditions.

The computational study of a model system shows robust enhancement of lifetimes of the decaying oscillations which translates into the evolution of the survival function of the transient non-equilibrium regime.

The model couples mass balances and kinetic equations for all components. Both single and multiple-component cases are considered with constant or variable velocity. Non-dimensionalisation indicates the small effect of diffusion. The system where diffusion is neglected is analysed using Laplace transforms. In the multiple-component case, it is demonstrated that the competition between the compounds is negligible and the equations may be decoupled. This reduces the problem to solving a single integral equation to determine the concentration profile for all components (since they are scaled versions of each other). For a given analyte, we then only two parameters need to be fitted to the data. To verify this approach, the full governing equations are also solved numerically using the finite difference method and a global adaptive quadrature method to integrate the Laplace transformation. Comparison with the Laplace solution verifies the high degree of accuracy of the simpler Laplace form. The Laplace solution is then verified against experimental data from BTEX chromatography. This novel method, which involves solving a single equation and fitting parameters in pairs for individual components, is highly efficient. It is significantly faster and simpler than the full numerical solution and avoids the computationally expensive methods that would normally be used to fit all curves at the same time.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

Studying its chemical composition and the level of its chemical diversity gives us insight into the evolution of the Milky Way and the role of gas in the Galactic environment. In this paper, we use a novel simulation technique to model the distribution of total hydrogen between gas components, and therefore derive new constraints on the dust depletion and metallicity. We study individual gas components along the lines of sight towards eight bright O/B stars within 1.1 kpc of the Sun using high-resolution HST/STIS absorption spectra (R sim 114 000). We measure the level of dust depletion for these individual components and find components with higher levels of dust depletion compared to Milky Way sightlines in the literature. We find large ranges in the level of dust depletion among components along lines of sight, up to 1.19 dex. Although it is not possible to directly measure the metallicity of individual components due to the saturated and damped Ly-alpha line, we investigate possible metallicity ranges for individual gas components by exploring many different distributions of the total hydrogen gas between components. We select possible combinations of these gas fractions which produce the minimum metallicity difference between components, and for these cases we determine individual metallicities to accuracies that range between sim 0.1 to 0.4 dex. This work shows that full line-of-sight analyses wash out the level of diversity along lines of sight, and that component-by-component studies give a more in-depth understanding of the chemical intricacies of the interstellar medium.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a large stationary background of so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump--probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton--exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we demonstrate both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excitation dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna LH2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump--probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

The utility and validity of this model are demonstrated for the first time on a cell with a sodium (Na) negative electrode and a Na-$_^{\\prime\\prime}$-alumina ceramic solid electrolyte (SE) separator. Three examples are simulated. First, stripping and plating with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface; second, stripping and plating with a single interfacial void at the electrode/electrolyte interface; third, stripping with multiple interfacial voids. Both homogeneous SE properties and polycrystalline SEs with either low or high conductivity grain boundaries (GBs) are considered for all three examples. Heterogeneous GB conductivity has no significant impact on the behavior with a perfect electrode/electrolyte interface. However, it does result in local changes to void growth due to interactions between the void edge and the GBs. The void growth rate is a linear function of the flux of Na atoms at the void edge, which in turn depends on the applied current density. We also show that the void coalescence rate increases with applied current density and can be marginally influenced by GB conductivity.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","2","synthetic_biology"

In this perspective article we discuss common notions, recent results and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of $_^{-1/2}$ appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of different deeply supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. Additionally, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic $_^{-1/2}$ behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape towards higher temperatures.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

UHDR radiotherapy, addressed in the field as FLASH radiotherapy, is a disruptive treatment modality with several benefits, including significantly shorter treatment times, unchanged effectiveness in treating tumors, and clear reductions in side effects on normal tissues. While the benefits of UHDR irradiation have been well highlighted experimentally, the biological mechanism underlying the FLASH effect is still unclear and highly debated. Nonetheless, to effectively use UHDR radiotherapy in clinics, understanding the driving biological mechanism is paramount. Since the concurrent involvement of multiple scales of radiation damage has been suggested, we developed the MultiScale Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (MS-GSM2), a multi-stage extension of the GSM2, which is a probabilistic model describing the time evolution of the DNA damage in an irradiated cell nucleus. The MS-GSM2 can investigate several chemical species combined effects, DNA damage formation, and time evolution. We demonstrate that the MS-GSM2 can predict various in-vitro UHDR experimental results across various oxygenation levels, radiation types, and energies. The MS-GSM2 can accurately describe the empirical trend of dose and dose rate-dependent cell sensitivity over a wide range, consistently describing multiple aspects of the FLASH effect and reproducing the main evidence from the in-vitro experimental data. Our model also proposes a consistent explanation for the differential outcomes observed in normal tissues and tumors, in-vivo and in-vitro.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

Rob_         _ More           Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is essential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often necessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas along the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a difficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line observations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling, which provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps of molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps calculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys conducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic model which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column density along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and a gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column density map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse (dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number densities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model of turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound structures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the model produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus L1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an effective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for astrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application of this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J = 1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the column density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

The Oxygen gradient is relatively flat, while the Nitrogen gradient is significantly steeper, indicating a higher N/O ratio in M31's inner regions, consistent with recent simulations of galaxy chemical evolution. No strong evidence was found of systematic galaxy-scale trends beyond the radial gradient. After subtracting the radial gradient from abundance values, we find an apparently stochastic and statistically significant scatter of standard deviation 0.06 dex, which exceeds measurement uncertainties. One explanation includes a possible collision with M32 200 - 800 Myrs ago. Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we find that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc scales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an exponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned recent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust continuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with the Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the $_^{\\prime}(^{12}\\mathrm{CO})$ factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass.

We develop modeling techniques to characterize the ionized gas properties in the subset of 2052 star-forming galaxies from the volume-limited, dwarf-dominated, z~0 ECO catalog. The MULTIGRIS statistical framework is used to evaluate the performance of various models using strong lines as constraints. The reference model involves physical parameters distributed as power-laws with free parameter boundaries. Specifically, we use combinations of 1D photoionization models (i.e., considering the propagation of radiation toward a single cloud) to match optical HII region lines, in order to provide probability density functions of the inferred parameters. The inference predicts non-uniform physical conditions within galaxies. The integrated spectra of most galaxies are dominated by relatively low-excitation gas with a metallicity around 0.3 solar. Using the average metallicity in galaxies, we provide a new fit to the mass-metallicity relationship which is in line with direct abundance method determinations from the calibrated range at low metallicity to stacks at high metallicity. The average metallicity shows a weakly bimodal distribution which may be due related to external (e.g., refueling of non-cluster early-type galaxies above ~10^9.5 solar masses) or internal processes (more efficient star-formation in metal-rich regions). The specific line set used for inference affects the results and we identify potential issues with the use of the [SII] line doublet.

The N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines were analysed by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Our best-fit core model consists in a static inner region, embedded in an infalling envelope with an inner radius of approximately 3000 au (21' at 141 pc). The observed high-J lines of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ (with critical densities greater than 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) turn out to be very sensitive to depletion; the present single-dish observations are best explained with no depletion of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ in the inner core. The N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio that best reproduces our observations is 0.44, one of the largest observed to date in pre-stellar cores. Additionally, half of the molecules that we observed are deuterated isotopologues, confirming the high-level of deuteration towards this source.

We divided the stellar populations based on their formation channel: exsitu, endodebris, and insitu, and analyzed their chemical abundances, ages, and spatial distributions. Additionally, we explored correlations between halo mass, metallicity, and alpha element enrichment. CIELO simulations reveal that stellar halos are predominantly composed of accreted material (exsitu and endodebris stars), in agreement with previous works. The mass fraction of these populations is independent of stellar halo mass, though their metallicities scale linearly with it. Exsitu stars tend to dominate the outskirts and be more alpha rich and older, while endodebris stars are more prevalent at lower radii and tend to be less alpha rich and slightly younger. Massive stellar halos require a median of five additional satellites to build 90 percent of their mass, compared to lower mass halos, which typically need fewer (median of 2.5) and lower-mass satellites and are assembled earlier. The diversity of accreted satellite histories results in well defined stellar halo mass metallicity and [alpha/Fe] [Fe/H] relations, offering a detailed view of the chemical evolution and assembly history of stellar halos.

Usually, in astrophysics is used the Mixing Length Theory (MLT) for modeling the convective movement and, in general, it is used with the Schwarzschild instability criterion, which neglects the impact of chemical composition gradients in the development of convection. However, towards the end of central helium burning and during the thermal pulses in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) are produced stratification processes with inversions in the chemical gradient that would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion.

However, the [s/alpha] vs. age relations are not universal, varying with metallicity, location in the Galactic disc, and specific s-process elements. Current Galactic chemical evolution models struggle to reproduce the observed [s/alpha] increase at young ages. We provide chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disc to identify the conditions required to reproduce the observed [s/H], [s/Fe], and [s/alpha] vs. age relations. We adopt a multi-zone chemical evolution model including state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis prescriptions for neutron-capture elements (AGB stars, rotating massive stars, neutron star mergers, magneto-driven supernovae). We explore variations in gas infall, AGB yield dependencies on progenitor stars, and rotational velocity distributions for massive stars. Results are compared with open cluster data from the Gaia-ESO survey. A three-infall scenario for disc formation captures the rise of [s/alpha] with age in the outer regions but fails in the inner ones, especially for second s-process peak elements. Ba production in the last 3 Gyr of chemical evolution would need to increase by half to match observations. S-process contributions from low-mass AGB stars improve predictions but require increases not supported by nucleosynthesis calculations, even with potential i-process contribution. Variations in the metallicity dependence of AGB yields show inconsistent effects across elements. Distributions of massive star rotational velocities fail to improve results due to balanced effects on elements. We confirm that there is no single relationship [s/alpha] vs. age, but that it varies along the MW disc. Current prescriptions for neutron-capture element yields cannot fully capture the complexity of evolution, particularly in the inner disc.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

To this aim, we measured the electronic transport of a carbon nanotube based field effect transistor (CNTFET) constructed with an isolated single carbon nanotube subjected to controlled environments. More precisely, this distinction is made possible by observing the evolution of the transfer characteristic as a function of the electric field imposed by the gate voltage. It appears that the presence of water results in a displacement of the electrical neutrality point, corresponding to a charge transfer between the nanotube and its environment. Using this approach, we demonstrate the existence of 3 types of water molecules: (i) chemically adsorbed on the SiO\\textsubscript{2} surface of the substrate, i.e., forming silanol groups; (ii) physically adsorbed outside next to the nanotube; and (iii) confined inside the nanotube. The first one can only be eliminated by high temperature treatment under vacuum, the second one desorbs in a moderate vacuum at room temperature, while the confined water can be removed at room temperature at higher vacuum, i.e. $10^{-3}$ mbar. We also observe that both water adsorption outside and water confinement inside the nanotube are spontaneous and rather fast, i.e. less than 1 minute in our experimental conditions, while removing the water adsorbed outside and confined inside takes much longer, i.e. 40-60 minutes, thus indicating that water confinement is thermodynamically favorable. It is also shown that the metallicity of the nanotube has no qualitative influence on its interaction with water. Our results experimentally prove the stronger affinity of water for the inner surface of CNT than for the outer one.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to obtain molecular insights into this process. We consider idealized situations where the gel is modeled as a regular polymer network with the topology of a diamond lattice, and all free polymers and strands have the same length and consist of the same type of monomer. After bringing the gel and the polymer solution into contact, two time regimes are observed: An initial compression of the gel caused by the osmotic pressure of the solution, followed by an expansion due to swelling. We characterize the time evolution of density profiles, the penetration of free polymers into the gel and the connection between the gel and solution phase. The interfacial structure locally equilibrates after roughly 100 chain relaxation times. At late times, the free chains inside the gel undergo a percolation transition if the polymer concentration in the gel exceeds a critical value, which is of the same order as the overlap concentration. The fluctuations of the interface can be described by a capillary wave model that accounts for the elasticity of the gel. Based on this, we extract the interfacial tension of the gel-solution interface. Interestingly, both the interfacial tension and the local interfacial width increase with increasing free polymer concentration - in contrast to liquid-liquid interfaces, where these two quantities are typically anticorrelated.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

Both galaxies display evidence for N/O enhancement with respect to the z~0 sample, with log(N/O)=-1.07$\\pm$0.17 and log(N/O)=-0.86$\\pm$0.15 respectively.

Following the trend observed in other high-redshift sources, we find that the C/N ratios are lower at fixed O/H compared to the majority of local galaxies. In contrast to the top-heavy IMF invoked in some studies to explain low C/N ratios in metal-poor galaxies, we find, via comparison to chemical evolution models, that a standard or bottom-heavy IMF better explains the observed abundance ratios in more enriched systems due to an increase in N-enrichment from intermediate mass (4-7M$_{\\odot}$) stars. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of CNO abundances with JWST can reveal unique enrichment pathways in galaxies as a function of both metallicity and redshift.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

Despite their significance, discrepancies between observational data and theoretical models of massive stars challenge our understanding of these objects. A major uncertainty is the overdensity of B-type supergiants (BSGs) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, where models predict the end of the main sequence phase (or TAMS). Is uncertain whether the TAMS needs to be redefined or if the overdensity results from overlapping populations following different evolutionary paths. Conceived as direct descendants of O-type stars, BSGs may include stars not only evolving in the main sequence but also returning from a post-red supergiant phase. A representative fraction of massive stars are predicted to be products of binary interaction, creating additional evolutionary channels. In addition, some fundamental properties of BSGs such as the spin- and mass-loss rates are not as well constrained as in O-type stars, having a significant impact on massive star evolution. To overcome this situation, statistically significant spectroscopic samples offer a unique opportunity to study the physical and chemical properties of BSGs. Moreover, the advent of space astrometry and photometry missions such as Gaia and TESS has brought a new era for studying additional properties in detail. This thesis comprises the study of 1000 Galactic blue supergiants (O- and B-type) combining multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic data from the IACOB project and the ESO archive with Gaia distances and TESS photometry, becoming the largest holistic empirical study of the physical, chemical, and pulsational properties of these objects performed to date.

The Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) project aims to provide a homogeneous analysis of a sample of metal-poor stars ( [Fe/H]\\<-1.5) to improve our understanding of the nucleosynthesis of neutron capture elements, in particular the r-process elements, in the early Galaxy. Our data consist of a sample of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio UVES spectra. The chemical abundances were derived through spectrum synthesis, using the same model atmospheres and stellar parameters as derived in the first paper of the CERES series. We measured chemical abundances or upper limits of seven heavy neutron capture elements (Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) for a sample of 52 metal-poor giant stars. We estimated through the mean shift clustering algorithm that at Ba/H =-2.4 and Fe/H =-2.4 a variation in the trend of X/Ba with X=La,Nd,Sm,Eu, versus Ba/H occurs. This result suggests that, for Ba/H $\\<$$-2.4$, Ba nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way halo is primarily due to the $r$-process, while for Ba/H \\<-2.4 the effect of the s-process contribution begins to be visible. In our sample, stars with Ba/Eu compatible with a Solar System pure r-process value (hereafter, r-pure) do not show any particular trend compared to other stars, suggesting r-pure stars may form in similar environments to stars with less pure r-process enrichments. Homogeneous investigations of high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra are crucial for studying the heavy elements formation, as they provide abundances that can be used to test nucleosynthesis models as well as Galactic chemical evolution models.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

Recent surveys (e.g. GALAH) provide spectra for large numbers of nearby Sun-like stars, which provides an opportunity to apply our newly developed method for measuring metallicities, temperatures, and surface gravities - the EPIC algorithm - which yields improved ages via isochrone fitting. We test this on moving groups, by applying it to the large GALAH DR3 sample. This defines a sample of 72,288 solar analogue targets for which the stellar parameter measurements are most precise and reliable. These stars are used to estimate, and test the accuracy and precision of, age measurements derived with the SAMD isochrone fitting algorithm. Using these ages, we recover the age-metallicity relationships for nearby (<= 1 kpc) moving groups, traced by solar analogues, and analyse them with respect to the stellar kinematics. In particular, we found that the age-metallicity relationships of all moving groups follows a particular trend of young (age < 6 Gyr) stars having constant metallicity and older (age >= 6 Gyr) stars decreasing in metallicity with increasing age. The Hercules stream carries the highest fraction of metal-rich young stars (~ 0.1 dex) in our sample, which is consistent with a migrating population of stars from the inner Galaxy, and we discuss the possible causes of this migration in the context of our results.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

However, mountain pine beetle's eastward expansion across Canada has stalled unexpectedly, defying predictions of rapid spread through jack pine, a novel host tree. This study investigates the underlying causes of this deceleration using an integrative approach combining statistical modeling, simulations, and experimental data. We find that the slow spread is primarily due to mountain pine beetle's difficulty in finding and successfully attacking jack pine trees, rather than issues with reproduction or larval development. The underlying mechanism impeding beetle range expansion has been hypothesized to be lower pine volumes in eastern forests, which are primarily a consequence of lower stem density.

The main purpose of this paper is to test these yields on the chemical evolution of Galactic stars. To do that, we adopt well-tested chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disk, implementing both yields for single and binary-stripped massive stars. In particular, we assume different percentages of massive binary systems within the initial mass function. We compute the evolution of 22 chemical species starting from $^{4}$He to $^{64}$Zn.

Generally, the yields for single stars reproduce slightly better the observed solar abundances, although for several elements a large fraction of binaries helps in reproducing the observations; ii) different fractions of massive binaries (from 50% to 100%) produce negligible differences in the predicted solar abundances, whereas the differences are more marked between models with and without binary-stripped stellar yields; iii) for the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations, the yields including massive stars in binaries produce the best results for $^{52}$Cr, while for $^{12}$C, $^{39}$K, $^{40}$Ca and $^{24}$Mg the best results are obtained with Farmer's yields with no binaries.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

In the conventional QSCI, the Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, the preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to compute total energies accurately. In this work, we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty. In the HSB-QSCI, the Slater determinants are sampled from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions.

We have also numerically confirmed that the HSB-QSCI is robust to approximation errors of the Hamiltonian simulation, such as Trotter errors and the truncation errors of Hamiltonian term by maximum locality in the localized molecular orbital basis.

The deficiency in the $_$-elements with respect the Milky Way suggests a slower, less efficient early star formation history, similar to other massive satellites. $S$-process element patterns indicate significant enrichment from AGB stars over time.

A variety of novel enrichment pathways have been presented to explain the apparent nitrogen excess, invoking a wide range of processes from very massive stars to stripped binaries to fine-tuned star-formation histories. However, understanding the excitation mechanism responsible for the observed nebular emission is necessary to accurately infer chemical abundances. As of yet, the ionization sources of these galaxies have not been thoroughly explored, with radiative shocks left out of the picture. We present a suite of homogeneous excitation models for star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and radiative shocks, with which we explore possible explanations for the apparent nitrogen excess.

Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of >10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min.

We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity.

On the other hand, these galaxies show subsolar metallicity. The observed N/O ratios are difficult to reproduce in the framework of chemical evolution models for the Milky Way. Our aim is to reproduce these high N/O ratios with chemical evolution models assuming different histories of star formation triggering galactic winds coupled with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions for $^{14}$N, $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O and $^{56}$Fe. We compute several models for small galaxies ($10^{9}\\text{ - }10^{10}\\text{ M}_{\\odot}$) with high star formation efficiency and strong galactic winds. These winds are assumed to be differential, carrying out mainly the products of the explosion of core-collapse supernovae. We find that only models with high star formation rates, normal initial mass function, and differential galactic winds can reproduce the observed chemical abundances. We also find that with the same assumptions about star formation and galactic winds, but with a very rapid formation resulting from fast gas infall, we can also reproduce the estimated ages of these objects. We find no necessity to invoke peculiar nucleosynthesis from Population III stars, very massive stars and supermassive stars.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","1","origin_of_life"

We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","2","synthetic_biology"

Trends of alpha-elements, such as Mg, Si, and Ca, serve as powerful diagnostic tools, offering insights into star-formation rates and gas-infall history. However, high extinction has previously hindered such studies. In this study, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of M giants in the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC), focusing on alpha-element trends with metallicity. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra were obtained using the IGRINS spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope for nine M giants. Careful selection of spectral lines, based on a solar-neighborhood control sample of 50 M giants, was implemented to minimize systematic uncertainties. Our findings show enhanced alpha-element abundances in the predominantly metal-rich NSC stars, consistent with trends in the inner bulge. The NSC stars follow the high-[alpha/Fe] envelope seen in the solar vicinity's metal-rich population, indicating a high star-formation rate. The alpha-element trends decrease with increasing metallicity, also at the highest metallicities. Our results suggest the NSC population likely shares a similar evolutionary history with the inner bulge, challenging the idea of a recent dominant star formation burst. This connection between the NSC and the inner-disk sequence suggests that the chemical properties of extragalactic NSCs of Milky Way type galaxies could serve as a proxy for understanding the host galaxies' evolutionary processes.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

In this study, we have used neutron reflectometry to reveal the phase transformation during thin film growth driven by different annealing strategies. We examined the silicide formation when a thin layer of vanadium undergoes reactive diffusion with a silicon dioxide film on silicon at temperatures from 650-800 _C. To further investigate the time evolution of different phases under various annealing temperatures, a chemical model was developed and subsequent simulations were performed. The results of this model were validated using X-ray diffraction and cross-sectional TEM analysis. Correlations were observed between the structure and superconducting properties. Over-annealing films leads to complete depletion of the SiO$_2$ barrier layer, forming diffuse interfaces and driving the formation of undesirable silicon-rich silicides. Avoiding this by controlling time and temperature, allows higher quality superconducting films to be achieved. The $T_c$ of the films was found to be 13 K, and the annealing conditions influenced the critical fields and the paramagnetic Meissner effect near $T_c$. For optimally-annealed films, superconducting order parameters were calculated. Ginzberg-Landau theory was applied to explain flux penetration.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","2","synthetic_biology"

While our understanding of dust production and destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) is advancing, probing baryonic processes in the early Universe remains a complex task. We characterize the evolution of 98 z~5 star-forming galaxies observed as part of the ALPINE survey by constraining the physical processes underpinning the gas and dust production, consumption, and destruction in their ISM. We make use of chemical evolution models to simultaneously reproduce the observed dust and gas content. For each galaxy, we estimate initial gas mass, inflows and outflows, and efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We test the models with the canonical Chabrier and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs), with the latter enabling rapid dust production on shorter timescales. Our models successfully reproduce gas and dust content in older galaxies (> 600 Myr) regardless of the IMF, with Type II SNe as the primary dust source and no dust growth in ISM with moderate inflow of primordial gas. In case of intermediate-age galaxies (300 - 600 Myr), we reproduce the gas and dust content through Type II SNe and dust growth in ISM, though we observe an over-prediction of dust mass in older galaxies, potentially indicating an unaccounted dust destruction mechanism and/or an overestimation of the observed dust masses. The number of young galaxies (< 300 Myr) reproduced, increases for models assuming top-heavy IMF but with maximal prescriptions of dust production. Galactic outflows are necessary to reproduce observed gas and dust masses. The Chabrier IMF models reproduce 65% of galaxies, while top-heavy IMF models improve this to 93%, easing tensions with observations. Upcoming JWST data will refine these models by resolving degeneracies in intrinsic galaxy properties.         _ Less","","arXiv","2","2","multiple"

This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission.

Sublimating ices from radially drifting dust grains are often invoked to explain some of this diversity, particularly the H2O-rich discs. We use a 1D protoplanetary disc evolution code to model how radially drifting dust grains that transport ices inwards to snowlines impact the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. We explore differences between smooth discs and those where radial drift is impeded by dust trapping outside gas gaps and quantify the effects of gap location and formation time. Discs evolve through an initial H2O-rich phase due to sublimating ices, followed by a CO2-rich phase as H2O vapour advects onto the star and CO2 advects into the inner disc from its snowline. The inclusion of traps hastens the transition between the phases, raising the CO2/H2O ratio; gaps opened early or close-in produce lower increases by blocking more CO2 ice from reaching the inner disc. This leads to a potential correlation between CO2/H2O and gap location that occurs on Myr timescales for fiducial parameters. We produce synthetic spectra from the models which we analyse with 0D LTE slab models to understand how this evolution may be expressed observationally. Whether the evolution can be retrieved depends on the contribution of dust grains to the optical depth: dust that couples to the gas after crossing the H2O snowline can add to the continuum optical depth and obscure the delivered H2O, largely hiding the evolution in its visible column density. However, the CO2/H2O visible column density ratio is only weakly sensitive to dust continuum obscuration. This suggests it may be a clearer tracer of the impact of transport on chemistry than individual column densities for spectra that show weak features probing deep enough in the disc.

Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Here, the scale of biological agents covers a wide range, from nanomotors, cytoskeleton, and cells, to insects, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological active systems, various types of autonomous synthetic nano- and micromachines have been designed, which provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent active materials. A major challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherent non-equilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, interactions in ensembles of active agents are often non-additive and non-reciprocal. An important aspect of biological agents is their ability to sense the environment, process this information, and adjust their motion accordingly. It is an important goal for the engineering of micro-robotic systems to achieve similar functionality. With many fundamental properties of motile active matter now reasonably well understood and under control, the ground is prepared for the study of physical aspects and mechanisms of motion in complex environments, of the behavior of systems with new physical features like chirality, of the development of novel micromachines and microbots, of the emergent collective behavior and swarming of intelligent self-propelled particles, and of particular features of microbial systems. The vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of motile active matter poses major challenges, which can only be addressed by a truly interdisciplinary effort involving scientists from biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

Despite the prevalence of frequency-encoded signals in natural systems, fundamental challenges in designing and implementing frequency-responsive gene circuits have limited their development in synthetic biology. Here we present a Time-Resolved Gene Circuit (TRGC) architecture that enables frequency-to-amplitude signal conversion in engineered biological systems. Through systematic analysis, we establish a theoretical framework that guides the design of synthetic circuits capable of distinct frequency-dependent responses, implementing both high-pass and low-pass filtering behaviors. To enable rigorous characterization of these dynamic circuits, we developed a high-throughput automated platform that ensures stable and reproducible measurements of frequency-dependent r esponses across diverse conditions. Using this platform, we demonstrate that these frequency-modulated circuits can access cellular states unreachable through conventional amplitude modulation, significantly expanding the controllable gene expression space in multi-gene systems. Our results show that frequency modulation expands the range of achievable expression patterns when controlling multiple genes through a single input, demonstrating a new paradigm for engineering cellular behaviors. This work establishes frequency modulation as a powerful strategy for expanding the capabilities of engineered biological systems and enhancing cellular response to dynamic signals.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","2","synthetic_biology"

Existing deep learning methods often overlook the biological mechanisms underlying population activity and thus exhibit suboptimal performance with neuronal data and provide little to no interpretable information about neurons and their interactions. In response, we introduce SynapsNet, a novel deep-learning framework that effectively models population dynamics and functional interactions between neurons. Within this biologically realistic framework, each neuron, characterized by a latent embedding, sends and receives currents through directed connections. A shared decoder uses the input current, previous neuronal activity, neuron embedding, and behavioral data to predict the population activity in the next time step. Unlike common sequential models that treat population activity as a multichannel time series, SynapsNet applies its decoder to each neuron (channel) individually, with the learnable functional connectivity serving as the sole pathway for information flow between neurons. Our experiments, conducted on mouse cortical activity from publicly available datasets and recorded using the two most common population recording modalities (Ca imaging and Neuropixels) across three distinct tasks, demonstrate that SynapsNet consistently outperforms existing models in forecasting population activity. Additionally, our experiments on both real and synthetic data showed that SynapsNet accurately learns functional connectivity that reveals predictive interactions between neurons.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Two dominant approaches in this field are AutoRegressive (AR) models and Diffusion Models (DMs). However, genomic sequences are functionally heterogeneous, consisting of multiple connected regions (e.g., Promoter Regions, Exons, and Introns) where elements within each region come from the same probability distribution, but the overall sequence is non-homogeneous. This heterogeneous nature presents challenges for a single model to accurately generate genomic sequences. In this paper, we analyze the properties of AR models and DMs in heterogeneous genomic sequence generation, pointing out crucial limitations in both methods: (i) AR models capture the underlying distribution of data by factorizing and learning the transition probability but fail to capture the global property of DNA sequences. (ii) DMs learn to recover the global distribution but tend to produce errors at the base pair level. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose a post-training sampling method, termed Absorb & Escape (A&E) to perform compositional generation from AR models and DMs. This approach starts with samples generated by DMs and refines the sample quality using an AR model through the alternation of the Absorb and Escape steps. To assess the quality of generated sequences, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 species for conditional and unconditional DNA generation. The experiment results from motif distribution, diversity checks, and genome integration tests unequivocally show that A&E outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and DMs in genomic sequence generation.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

Phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategy, two key evolutionary traits living systems harness to optimize fitness in dynamic environments, have been widely reported yet how interplays therein could mediate fitness landscapes of heterogeneous populations remain unknown. Leveraging the financial asset pricing model, here we provide a dynamical framework for fitness of heterogeneous populations, underpinned by the interrelations between sub-populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedgeding. Our framework, independent of the definition of fitness, employs a nonlinear difference equation to present fitness dynamics, and capture the emergence of tipping points, marking the onset of critical state transitions which lead to catastrophic shifts. This study identifies limits on the selective advantage conferred by bet-hedging through reduction in the temporal variance of fitness, with far-reaching ramifications on our current understanding of hedging-mediated fitness enhancement of a population. The lower bound of the effective fitness variance is set by a maximum number of bet-hedgers, beyond which the fitness landscape approaches critical transition, as confirmed by critical slowing down in the vicinity of tipping points. We estimate the scaling law for the critical slowing down numerically and derive the characteristic recovery time for heterogeneous populations. Taken together, our work provides a generic theoretical framework to quantify fitness dynamics and predict critical transitions in heterogeneous populations. The results can be extended further to model fitness landscapes of natural and synthetic multi-species consortia exposed to environmental fluctuations mimicking climatic shifts and immunopathological settings.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

In this work, we take inspiration from both strategies and propose an amortized algorithm for refining domain knowledge, based on data observations.

Therefore, generative protein modeling necessitates a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and generate both sequences and structures. However, existing methods typically use separate models for each modality, limiting their ability to capture the intricate relationships between sequence and structure. This results in suboptimal performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce DPLM-2, a multimodal protein foundation model that extends discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) to accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable structural learning with the language model, 3D coordinates are converted to discrete tokens using a lookup-free quantization-based tokenizer.

Empirical evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate highly compatible amino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D structures eliminating the need for a two-stage generation approach. Moreover, DPLM-2 demonstrates competitive performance in various conditional generation tasks, including folding, inverse folding, and scaffolding with multimodal motif inputs, as well as providing structure-aware representations for predictive tasks.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks.

We publish source code and a novel dataset of cancerous tumors (chimeric cell clusters).         _ More           We present a novel method that extends the self-attention mechanism of a vision transformer (ViT) for more accurate object detection across diverse datasets. ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to their ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual tokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they do not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with neighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic because tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other tokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is further compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from different semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these limitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention framework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature mixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction and feature exchange between semantic concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that local and global information exchange among visual features before self-attention significantly improves performance on challenging object detection tasks and generalizes across multiple benchmark datasets and challenging medical datasets. We publish source code and a novel dataset of cancerous tumors (chimeric cell clusters).         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Accurate and efficient detection and prevention of biofilms are challenging and demand interdisciplinary approaches. This multidisciplinary research reports the application of a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model for detecting biofilms produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with high accuracy. Aptamer DNA templated silver nanocluster (Ag-NC) was used to prevent biofilm formation, which produced images of the planktonic states of the bacteria. Large-volume bright field images of bacterial biofilms were used to design the AI model. In particular, we used U-Net with ResNet encoder enhancement to segment biofilm images for AI analysis. Different degrees of biofilm structures can be efficiently detected using ResNet18 and ResNet34 backbones.

However, most existing WSI datasets lack cell-level annotations, owing to the extremely high cost over giga-pixel images. Thus, it remains an open question whether deep learning models can directly and effectively analyze WSIs from the semantic aspect of cell distributions. In this work, we construct a large-scale WSI dataset with more than 5 billion cell-level annotations, termed WSI-Cell5B, and a novel hierarchical Cell Cloud Transformer (CCFormer) to tackle these challenges. WSI-Cell5B is based on 6,998 WSIs of 11 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program, and all WSIs are annotated per cell by coordinates and types. To the best of our knowledge, WSI-Cell5B is the first WSI-level large-scale dataset integrating cell-level annotations. On the other hand, CCFormer formulates the collection of cells in each WSI as a cell cloud and models cell spatial distribution. Specifically, Neighboring Information Embedding (NIE) is proposed to characterize the distribution of cells within the neighborhood of each cell, and a novel Hierarchical Spatial Perception (HSP) module is proposed to learn the spatial relationship among cells in a bottom-up manner. The clinical analysis indicates that WSI-Cell5B can be used to design clinical evaluation metrics based on counting cells that effectively assess the survival risk of patients. Extensive experiments on survival prediction and cancer staging show that learning from cell spatial distribution alone can already achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, i.e., CCFormer strongly outperforms other competing methods.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

The non-spatial version successfully demonstrated continuous adaptation and unbounded growth of complexity of self-replicating entities, but it did not simulate multiscale ecological interactions among the entities. On the contrary, the cellular version explicitly represented multiscale spatial ecological interactions among evolving patterns, yet it failed to show meaningful adaptive evolution or complexity growth. It remains an open question whether it is possible to create a similar minimalistic evolutionary system that can exhibit all of those desired properties at once within a computationally efficient framework. Here we propose an improved version called Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry (SCHC). In SCHC, individual identities of evolving patterns are explicitly represented and processed as the connected components of the nearest neighbor graph of active cells. The neighborhood connections are established by connecting active cells with other active cells in their Moore neighborhoods in a 2D cellular grid. Evolutionary dynamics in SCHC are simulated via pairwise competitions of two randomly selected patterns, following the approach used in the non-spatial Hash Chemistry. SCHC's computational cost was significantly less than the original and non-spatial versions. Numerical simulations showed that these model modifications achieved spontaneous movement, self-replication and unbounded growth of complexity of spatial evolving patterns, which were clearly visible in space in a highly intuitive manner. Detailed analysis of simulation results showed that there were spatial ecological interactions among self-replicating patterns and their diversity was also substantially promoted in SCHC, neither of which was present in the non-spatial version.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","5","synthetic_biology"

Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an emerging scheme used at inference time to address this issue. In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when making predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained attention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to alleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to their inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful patterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we study the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the underlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram, a classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on this observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram guidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this geometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1) Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution of self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2) Power Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines partitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under rigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore the effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly encountered in real-world applications. These analyses further validate the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

Traditionally, cognition was believed to be exclusive to humans and a result of brain activity. However, recent studies reveal it as a fundamental characteristic of all life forms, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms and their networks. Yet, the literature and general understanding of cognition still largely remain human-brain-focused, leading to conceptual gaps and incoherency. This paper presents a variety of computational (information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach to cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical processes on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an observing cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent morphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly, self-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological domains.

Abnormal cell growth in the squamous epithelial lining of the cervix leads to cervical cancer in females. A Pap smear is a diagnostic procedure used to detect cervical cancer by gently collecting cells from the surface of the cervix with a small brush and analyzing their changes under a microscope. For population-based cervical cancer screening, visual inspection with acetic acid is a cost-effective method with high sensitivity. However, Pap smears are also suitable for mass screening due to their higher specificity. The current Pap smear analysis method is manual, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Therefore, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for automatic cell classification is needed. In this study, we aimed to classify cells in Pap smear images into five categories: superficial-intermediate, parabasal, koilocytes, dyskeratotic, and metaplastic. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor, as well as deep learning (DL) approaches like ResNet-50, were employed for this classification task. The ML models demonstrated high classification accuracy; however, ResNet-50 outperformed the others, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.06%. This study highlights the efficiency of DL models for cell-level classification and their potential to aid in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer from Pap smear images.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $_(\\vec{x})$, and $v_{\\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\\sim$10.2\\% and $\\sim$9.2\\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Results demonstrate that PROTEUS consistently produces reliable, logically coherent results that align well with existing literature while also proposing novel, evaluable hypotheses. The system's flexible architecture facilitates seamless integration of diverse analysis tools and adaptation to different proteomics data types.

This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors.

Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and can self-organize their geometry to achieve a homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that, through erosion, artificial flow networks self-organize to a geometry where perfusion is more homogeneous. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

In contrast, active colloids, their synthetic counterparts, currently lack similar abilities and strategies. Through physical interactions alone, here we create active colloidal molecules that spontaneously reconfigure their structure, unlike traditional active particles. We find that self-reconfiguration decouples reorientational dynamics from rotational diffusivity and bestows our active molecules additional reorientation capabilities. During encounters with neighbors, rapid conformational changes lead to self-steering and avoidance. At higher area fractions, reconfiguration-induced avoidance fully inhibits characteristic dynamic clustering, motility-induced phase separation and flocking; instead, the system retains a homogeneous structure comprising well-separated active units. Self-reconfiguring systems therefore present an exciting path towards autonomous motion beyond that of classical synthetic active matter.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

The most common structural motif is a spherical QD comprising a PbSe core enclosed into a CdSe shell. However, the potential barrier created by the CdSe shell complicates extraction of band-edge charge carriers from the QD. Therefore, conventional PbSe/CdSe QDs are not suitable for applications in practical photoconversion devices. Here we report inverted CdSe/PbSe core/shell QDs that overcome this drawback. In these structures, both photocarriers (electron and hole) exhibit a significant degree of shell localization and are therefore free to move within the QD solid and be extracted into an external circuit. To create such QDs, we employ a novel synthetic method in which a thin, atomically controlled wetting layer is used to homogenize the surface of the CdSe core and thus promote directionally uniform growth of the PbSe shell. Unlike noninverted QDs, inverted core/shell structures exhibit highly efficient photocarrier transport, making them excellent candidates for applications in practical photoconversion including photovoltaics, photodetection, and photochemistry.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6$\\pm$0.6$\\cdot$10$^{-15}$ Nm torque while applying 373$\\pm$5 mT field at 12$\\pm$2 degrees to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 $_$m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a $\\approx$ 1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles' mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high PMA.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

The wealth of observational data collected by the AGILE and Fermi gamma-ray space telescopes in the GeV range, and by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes in the TeV band provide invaluable insights into how relativistic plasmas dissipate and accelerate particles. Decoding the information contained in the gamma-ray pulses profile is an important step to understand how pulsars work. In this study, we aim at putting an ab initio plasma model of pulsar magnetospheres to the test, in light of the most recent gamma-ray observations in the GeV and TeV bands. To this end, we present of a new series of global particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar magnetosphere. High-quality synthetic pulse profiles in the synchrotron and inverse Compton channels are reconstructed to study in greater details their morphology and their energy dependence. We also perform a fit of observed lightcurves with the model, using the third Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar catalog. Reconnection in the wind current sheet powers synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The modeled pulse profiles reproduce some of the salient features of observed gamma-ray pulsars, including the mysterious Vela-like lightcurves, such as: the generic double-peaked structure, the presence of a bridge or third peak in between the main pulses, the pulse narrowing with increasing energy. The bolometric synchrotron radiative efficiency is strictly limited by the reconnection rate. Our global kinetic simulations are able to match observed pulse profiles. Such direct comparisons will help drive and focus future simulation developments.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

Specialized techniques like shadowgraphy and particle image velocimetry can reveal gas-liquid interface evolution and internal velocity fields; however, they are largely limited to planar measurements, while flow dynamics are inherently three-dimensional (3D). Deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks provide a powerful approach for volumetric reconstruction based on the experimental data by leveraging spatial structure of images and extracting context-rich features. Building on this foundation, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a complementary and promising alternative integrating prior knowledge in the form of governing equations into the networks training process. This integration enables accurate predictions even with limited data. By combining the strengths of both approaches, we propose a novel convolutional feature-enhanced PINNs framework, designed for the spatio-temporal reconstruction of two-phase flows from color-coded shadowgraphy images. The proposed approach is first validated on synthetic data generated through direct numerical simulation, demonstrating high spatial accuracy in reconstructing the three-dimensional gas-liquid interface, along with the inferred velocity and pressure fields. Subsequently, we apply this method to interface reconstruction for an impinging droplet using planar experimental data, highlighting the practical applicability and significant potential of the proposed approach to real-world fluid dynamics analysis.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

However, we still lack the understanding needed to recreate at the microscale key features of autonomous behavior exhibited by microorganisms or swarms of macroscopic robots. In this study, we propose a model for a three-dimensional deformable cellular composite particle consisting of self-propelled rod-shaped colloids confined within a flexible vesicle - a superstructure we call a 'flexicle'. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the collective behavior of dense systems comprised of many flexicles. We show that individual flexicles exhibit shape changes upon collisions with other flexicles that lead to rearrangement of the internal active rods that slow the flexicle motion significantly. This shape deformability gives rise to a diverse set of motility-induced phase separation phenomena and the spontaneous flow of flexicles akin to the migration of cells in dense tissues. Our findings establish a foundation for designing responsive cell-like active particles and developing strategies for controlling swarm migration and other autonomous swarm behaviors at cellular and colloidal scales.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","1","multiple"

While recent observations have detected non-Keplerian gas motions in disks, their origins are still being debated. To explore this, we conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations using the code FARGO3D to study non-axisymmetric kinematic perturbations at 2 scale heights induced by Jovian planets in protoplanetary disks, followed by examinations of detectable signals in synthetic CO emission line observations at millimeter wavelengths. We advocate for using residual velocity or channel maps, generated by subtracting an azimuthally averaged background of the disk, to identify planet-induced kinematic perturbations. We investigate the effects of two basic simulation parameters, simulation duration and numerical resolution, on the simulation results. Our findings suggest that a short simulation (e.g., 100 orbits) is insufficient to establish a steady velocity pattern given our chosen viscosity ($_=10^{-3}$), and displays plenty of fluctuations on orbital timescale. Such transient features could be detected in observations. By contrast, a long simulation (e.g., 1,000 orbits) is required to reach steady state in kinematic structures. At 1,000 orbits, the strongest and detectable velocity structures are found in the spiral wakes close to the planet. Through numerical convergence tests, we find hydrodynamics results converge in spiral regions at a resolution of 14 cells per disk scale height (CPH) or higher. Meanwhile, synthetic observations produced from hydrodynamic simulations at different resolutions are indistinguishable with 0.1$^{\\prime\\prime}$ angular resolution and 10 hours of integration time on ALMA.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

Operating far from equilibrium, no general theory links microscopic reaction networks and parameters to the pattern type and dynamics. We discover a generic mechanism giving rise to an effective interfacial tension organizing the macroscopic structure of non-equilibrium steady-state patterns. Namely, maintaining protein-density interfaces by cyclic protein attachment and detachment produces curvature-dependent protein redistribution which straightens the interface. We develop a non-equilibrium Neumann angle law and Plateau vertex conditions for interface junctions and mesh patterns, thus introducing the concepts of ``Turing mixtures'' and ``Turing foams''. In contrast to liquid foams and mixtures, these non-equilibrium patterns can select an intrinsic wavelength by interrupting an equilibrium-like coarsening process. Data from in vitro experiments with the E. coli Min protein system verifies the vertex conditions and supports the wavelength dynamics.

Compared to existing DIHM methods that face challenges with twin image and phase retrieval problems, MorpHoloNet enables direct reconstruction of 3D complex light field and 3D morphology of a test sample from its single-shot hologram without requiring multiple phase-shifted holograms or angle scanning. The performance of the proposed MorpHoloNet is validated by reconstructing 3D morphologies and refractive index distributions from synthetic holograms of ellipsoids and experimental holograms of biological cells. The proposed deep learning model is utilized to reconstruct spatiotemporal variations in 3D translational and rotational behaviors and morphological deformations of biological cells from consecutive single-shot holograms captured using DIHM.

Advances in next-generation sequencing enable detailed yet destructive gene expression assays at the single-cell level, resulting in the loss of cell evolutionary trajectories. Due to technological and cost constraints, single-cell experiments often feature cells sampled at irregular and sparse time points with a small sample size. Although trajectory-based structural inference models can accurately reveal the underlying interaction graph from observed data, their efficacy depends on the inputs of thousands of regularly sampled trajectories. The irregularly-sampled nature of single-cell data precludes the direct use of these powerful models for reconstructing GRNs. Optimal transport, a classical mathematical framework that minimize transportation costs between distributions, has shown promise in multi-omics data integration and cell fate prediction. Utilizing OT, our method constructs mappings between consecutively sampled cells to form cell-level trajectories, which are given as input to a structural inference model that recovers the GRN from single-cell data. Through case studies in two synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method and its promising performance over eight state-of-the-art GRN inference methods.         _ Less","","arXiv","0","1","synthetic_biology"

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

In particular, these waves play a major role in force generation and long-range signal transmission in cells that dynamically change shape, as encountered during cell division or morphogenesis. Reconstituting and controlling such chemically controlled cell deformations is a crucial but unsolved challenge for the development of synthetic cells. Here, we develop an optogenetic method to elucidate the mechanism responsible for coordinating surface contraction waves that occur in oocytes of the starfish Patiria miniata during meiotic cell division. Using spatiotemporally-patterned light stimuli as a control input, we create chemo-mechanical cortical excitations that are decoupled from meiotic cues and drive diverse shape deformations ranging from local pinching to surface contraction waves and cell lysis. We develop a quantitative model that entails the hierarchy of chemical and mechanical dynamics, which allows to relate the variety of mechanical responses to optogenetic stimuli. Our framework systematically predicts and explains transitions of programmed shape dynamics. Finally, we qualitatively map the observed shape dynamics to elucidate how the versatility of intracellular protein dynamics can give rise to a broad range of mechanical phenomenologies.

From this indirect interaction collective effects emerge that can be used by the agents to migrate collectively, to form patterns or to search for targets more efficiently. Here, we use paradigmatic models to study the efficiency of collective search strategies of a large group of motile agents that release during their movement repulsive auto-chemotactic signals forcing them to move away from high concentrations of the chemical clue. We show that the repulsive chemotactic interactions improve the search efficiency, measured by the mean first passage time to find a randomly located target, by orders of magnitude depending on the strength of the chemotactic coupling. The mechanism for this improvement relies on two factors: the increase of the persistence length due to the agent's self-interaction with its own chemotactic field and by a more homogeneous distribution of the agents due to their mutual indirect repulsion mediated by the chemotactic field. At stronger particle-field coupling the chemotactic searchers self-organize into ballistically moving bands reminiscent of search-chains formed in search and rescue operations, whose efficiency depends on the number of searchers involved. Our comprehensive study of collective search strategies of large groups of interacting agents is not only relevant for chemotactic active matter but also for a wide range of fields like ethology, information engineering, robotics, and social engineering.         _ Less","","arXiv","1","0","origin_of_life"

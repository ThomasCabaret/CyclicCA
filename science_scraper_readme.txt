SCIENCE SCRAPPER README

Steps to scrap and display articles
Go to the directory containing scraper.py and index.html.
Run the scraper: python scraper.py.
This generates a file called articles.csv containing the scraped articles.
Start a local server in the same directory: python -m http.server.
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/index.html to view the articles.
Key files and roles
scraper.py: Python script to scrape articles from Google Scholar and arXiv.
articles.csv: CSV file generated by the scraper containing the scraped articles with their scores and themes.
index.html: Local webpage to dynamically load and display articles with filtering and sorting options.
Functionalities
The scraper uses keywords to search and compute theme scores for origin_of_life and synthetic_biology.
The scraper skips articles with a score of 0 in both categories.
The webpage dynamically reads articles.csv and allows filtering by theme and sorting by date or score.
